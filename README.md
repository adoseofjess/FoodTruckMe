# Food Truck Me
This web app was implemented for Uber's full-stack coding challenge [here](https://github.com/uber/coding-challenge-tools/blob/master/coding_challenge.md#food-trucks).

It displays location data about food trucks in San Francisco via markers on a Google map. The user can search for a specific location on the map or view all food trucks in the area. By clicking on a specific location marker, the user can see specific information about the food truck, including its name, address, available food items, hours, location description, and a link to Google map directions based on the user's current address.
